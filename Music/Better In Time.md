Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now

But hey what'd daddy always tell you

Straighten up little soldier stiffen up that upper lip

What you cryin' about

You got me

Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad

When I'm gone but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had

I Can see you're sad even when you smile even when you laugh

I can see it in your eyes deep inside you wanna cry

'Cause you're scared I ain't there

Daddy's with you in your prayers

No more cryin' wipe them tears

Daddy's here no more nightmares

We gon' pull together through it

We gon' do it Lainie Uncle's crazy ain't be

Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it

We're all we got in this world when it spins when it swirls

When it whirls when it twirls two little beautiful girls

Lookin' puzzled in a daze I know it's confusin' you

Daddy's always on the move

Momma's always on the news

I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems

The harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me

All the things growin' up as daddy that he had to see

Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did

We did not plan it to be this way your mother and me

But things have got so bad between us I don't see us ever bein'

Together ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers

But then of course everything always happens for a reason

I guess it was never meant to be but it's just something

We have no control over and that's what destiny is

But no more worries rest your head and go to sleep

Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll just be a dream

I cloudn't turn on the TV

Without something there to remind me

Was it all that easy

To just put aside your feelings

If I'm dreaming don't wanna laugh

Hurt my feelings but that's the path

I believe in and I know that time will heal it

If you didn't notice boy you meant everything

Quickly I'm learning to love again

All I know is I'mma be okay

Thought I couldn't live without you

It's gonna hurt when it heals too

Oh yeah

It'll all get better in time

And even though I really love you

I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to

It'll all get better in time

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce

'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama

And when it seems that I'm hopeless

You say the words that can get me back in focus

When I was sick as a little kid

To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did

And all my childhood memories

Are full of all the sweet things you did for me

And even though I act crazy

I gotta thank the Lord that you made me

There are no words that can express how I feel

You never kept a secret always stayed real

And I appreciate how you raised me

And all the extra love that you gave me

I wish I could take the pain away

If you can make it through the night there's a brighter

Everything will be alright if you hold on

It's a struggle every day gotta roll on

And there's no way I can pay you back my plan

Is to show you that I understand

You are appreciated

Dear mama

It'll all get better in time

You are appreciated

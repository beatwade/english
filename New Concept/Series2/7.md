Too late

The plane was late and detetives were waiting at the airport all morning

They were expecting a valuable parcel of diamonds from South Africa

A few hours earlier, someone had told the policee that thieves would try to steal the diamonds

When the plane arrived, some of the detectives were waiting inside the main building while others were waiting on the airfield

Two men took the parcel off the plane and carried it into the Customs House

While two detectives were keeping guard at the door, two others opened the parcel

To their surprise, the precious parcel was full of stones and stand!

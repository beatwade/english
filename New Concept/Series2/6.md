I have just moved to a house in Bridge Street

Yesterday a begger knocked at my door

He asked me for a meal and a glass of beer

In return for this, the beggar stood on his head and sang songs

I gave him a meal

he ate the food and drank the beer

Then he put a piece of cheese in this pocket and went away

Later a neighbour told me about him

Everybody knows him. His name is Percy Buttons

he calls at every house in the street once a mouth and always asks for a meal and a glass of beer

I have just receive a letter from my brother, Tim

He is in Australia. He has been there for six months

Tim is a engineer

He is working for a big firm and he has already visited a great number of different places in Australia

He has just bought an Australian car and has gone to Alice springs, a small town in the center of Australia

He will soon visit Darwin. From there. he will fly to Perth

My brother has never been abroad before, so he is finding this trip very exciting

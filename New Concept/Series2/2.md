It was sunday, I never get up early on Sundays

I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime

Last Sunday I got up very late

I looked out of the window. It was dark outside

What a day! I thought. It's raining again

Just then, the telephone rang

It was my aunt Lucy

I've just arrived by train, She said, I'm coming to see you

but I'm still having breakfast, I said

What are you doing? she asked

I'm having breakfast, I repeated

Dear me! She said Do you always get up so late? It's one O'clock

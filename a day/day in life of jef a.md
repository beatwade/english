I had a roommate alarm

that drive me nuts

as I was singing , I sometime wake up earlier in the morning
I was not a good boy, as the alarm

we somethings got gun fire. I was just kidding
it's easier to get a wake up phone

people raiser late verb jump out of bed

take on the world , do my best, instead i get up very
every once in a while ,when I over sleep. at the end of story. until 9 am

the worst part of me, the cover

I get up very slowly, not too ofen, I really love the weekend.

get up
to wake up

waking up are something I can hanle . somthing that I can manage.
the covers are the tings blanket, flatshit

blanket something you are
keep you warm

we have a comfort night blanket

a pillow is what you put your head on when you sleep

alarm goes off

as I was saying. I sometimes make some noise. we mean someone is making
the verb is meaning cardoor

I was sometimes slam the door

man is my neiborhood noise

is a wake up call hotel

at the end of story, I'm not a end up , you could be a lazy writer. I'm not a early writer, I don't jump out of bed

instead I get up very slowly

all the years , I still feel like an outsider when I come here

you've five northern children, you are not an outsider

I wonder if the old gods agree

It's your gods with all the rules

I'm so sorry my love

Tell me,

There is a raven from kingslanding

John Arie is dead, a fever took him

I know he was like a father to you

your sister and the boys?

They both have the healty

god will be good

The rave bought more news

The king rides for winterfell

With the queen and all the rest of them

He is coming this far north

And there is one thing he is after

you can always say no nerd

We need plenty candles for lord tiliang's chiber?

I'm told he reads all night,

I'm told he drinks all night

How much he possibaly drink

perhaps will find out

.....
....

....

gods, but they grow fast

Bran den, I saw the king, he is ... hundred people

But he is coming right now

I want you to promise me, no more climbling

I promise

Do you know what?

What?

You always look at your feet when you lie

Run and find your father, tell him the king is close

Where is Arya

Sansa, where is your sister

you don't wear that ..? go on

move

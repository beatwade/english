The hardest thing is how does that fit in to a cohesive larger vision
that's gonna allow you to sell eight billion dollars, ten billion dollars of product a year

one of the things I've always found is that you've gotta start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology

you can't start with the technology and try to figure out where you're gonna try to sell it
and I've made this mistake probably more than anybody else in this room

and I've got the scar tissue to prove it and I know that it's the case

it started with what incredible benefits can we give to the customer

where can we take the customer, not starting with let's sit down with the engineers

and figure out what awesome technology we have and then how we going to market that

one of the hardest things when you're trying to affect change
is that people like this gentleman are right, in some areas

I'm sure that there are some things OpenDoc does, probably even more
